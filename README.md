# Solar System

## Description
This application serves as an educational resource on our solar system. When the page loads, the user sees all 8 planet cards. The user can mouse over any of the planet cards to see a visual representation of the planet. When a card is clicked the user is taken to a full size card which includes the name, image, and more information about the planet. To exit, the user can click the red 'x' in the upper right hand corner or use the search bar. If the user input in the search bar matches a planet name or any of the words in a planet's description, the matching planet cards will display.  

Concepts covered: vanilla JavaScript, JSON, XHR calls, and event-listeners.
